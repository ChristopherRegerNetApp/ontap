[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, cluster administrators can non-disruptively relocate an SVM from a source cluster to a destination cluster to manage capacity and load balancing, or to enable equipment upgrades or data center consolidations by using the ONTAP CLI. 

This non-disruptive SVM relocation capability is supported on AFF platforms in ONTAP 9.10.1 and 9.11.1. Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, this capability is supported on both FAS and AFF platforms and on hybrid aggregates.

The SVMâ€™s name and UUID remain unchanged after migration, as well as the data LIF name, IP address, and object names, such as the volume name. The UUID of the objects in the SVM will be different.

== SVM migration workflow

The diagram depicts the typical workflow for an SVM migration. You start an SVM migration from the destination cluster. You can monitor the migration from either the source or the destination. You can perform a manual cutover or an automatic cutover. An automatic cutover is performed by default.

== Supported configurations

The table indicates the configurations supported and the ONTAP releases in which support is available.

[NOTE]

 When migrating from an AFF cluster to a FAS cluster with hybrid aggregates, auto volume placement will attempt to perform a like to like aggregate match. For example, if the source cluster has 60 volumes, the volume placement will try to find an AFF aggregate on the destination to place the volumes. When there is no sufficient space on the AFF aggregates, the volumes will be placed on aggregates with non-flash disks.


== Prerequisites

* You must be a cluster administrator
* The source and destination clusters must peered to each other
+
link:https://review.docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap_main/peering/create-cluster-relationship-93-later-task.html[Create a cluster peer relationship]
* The source and destination clusters must have the Data Protection Bundle license installed
* All nodes in the source cluster must be running ONTAP 9.10.1 or later
* All nodes in the source cluster must be running the same ONTAP version
* All nodes in the destination cluster must be running the same ONTAP version
* The destination cluster must be at the same or newer effective cluster version (ECV) as the source cluster
* The source and destination clusters must support the same IP subnet for data LIF access
* The network connecting the source and destination clusters must have a maximum round trip time (RTT) of less than 10ms
* The source SVM must contain fewer than the maximum number of supported data volumes for the release. The maximum number of data volumes supported is as follows:
** AFF arrays: 200 data volumes with clusters running ONTAP 9.13.1 and later releases, and 100 data volumes with clusters running ONTAP 9.12.1 and earlier releases.
** FAS platforms: 80 data volumes
* Sufficient space for volume placement must be available on the destination
* Onboard Key Manager must be configured on the destination if the source SVM has encrypted volumes

== Conflicting operations

You should check for operations that can conflict with an SVM migration:

* No failover operations are in progress
* WAFLIRON cannot be running
* Fingerprint is not in progress
* Vol move, rehost, clone, create, convert or analytics are not running

| Asynchronous SnapMirror copy-to-cloud relationships
| No
| No
| Yes
| Yes
| Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, when you migrate an SVM with SnapMirror Copy to Cloud relationships, the migrate destination cluster must have the copy to cloud license installed and must have enough capacity available to support moving the capacity in the volumes that are being mirrored to the cloud.

| Asynchronous SnapMirror source

* Transfers can continue as normal on FlexVol SnapMirror relationships during most of the migration.
* Any ongoing transfers are canceled during cutover and new transfers fail during cutover and they cannot be restarted until the migration completes.
* Scheduled transfers that were canceled or missed during the migration are not automatically started after the migrate completes.

[NOTE]
====
When a SnapMirror source is migrated, ONTAP does not prevent deletion of the volume after migration until the SnapMirror update takes place after. This happens because SnapMirror-related information for migrated SnapMirror source volumes is known only after first update after migrate is complete.
